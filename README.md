# 🚀 Applications of Large Language Models and Prompt Optimization in Image Understanding of Biological Pathway Figures

**LLM-GPV (Large Language Model - Genetic Prompt Vision)** is an open-source platform that revolutionizes the extraction of gene interactions from complex biological pathway images. By combining large language models (LLMs) with automated genetic algorithm-based prompt optimization, LLM-GPV delivers high-throughput, robust, and interpretable extraction of both directional and non-directional gene relationships.LLM-GPV supports state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (including Llama 3.2V) and is optimized for tumor signaling pathway curation, providing a scalable, research-friendly alternative to traditional OCR-based approaches.
