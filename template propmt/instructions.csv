Instruction
"Symbols in the diagram represent specific interactions: ""Inhibition"" is shown by T-bar symbols (----|), with dashed T-bars indicating ""Indirect Inhibition."" ""Activation"" is represented by arrow symbols (?), with dashed arrows for ""Indirect Activation."" Arrows point from gene1 (starter) to gene2 (receptor)."
"Use the diagram's symbols: ""Inhibition"" is marked by T-bars (----|), with dashed T-bars for ""Indirect Inhibition."" ""Activation"" is denoted by arrows (?), with dashed arrows for ""Indirect Activation."" The arrow direction indicates the flow between gene1 and gene2."
"Refer to the symbols in the diagram: T-bars (----|) indicate ""Inhibition,"" with dashed T-bars for ""Indirect Inhibition."" Arrows (?) show ""Activation,"" with dashed arrows representing ""Indirect Activation."" Arrows indicate the direction of interaction from gene1 to gene2."
